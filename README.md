Title:
“ Exploring COVID-19-Related Mortality Patterns: Statistical
Analysis and Insights from a Comprehensive Dataset”

● Introduction:
In this dataset, we have a comprehensive collection of data spanning
from January 1, 2020, to July 22, 2023, pertaining to COVID-19-related
deaths classified by various demographic factors, conditions, and age groups
within the United States. The dataset encompasses respiratory diseases,
particularly focusing on cases involving influenza and pneumonia (ICD10
codes J09-J18).Through this study, our objective is to conduct a rigorous
statistical analysis employing a range of sampling techniques, confidence
interval estimation, and hypothesis testing. By employing these analytical
tools, we aim to glean valuable insights into the patterns and trends
underlying the data, unraveling intricate associations between age groups,
condition categories, and COVID-19-related mortality rates.

● Data Availability:
The data for this study was sourced from the U.S. Chronic
Disease Indicators (CDI) dataset, available through the website
